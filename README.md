#hotstar
:point_right: This project is a clone of the popular streaming platform Hotstar, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Through this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of front-end development by replicating a complex, dynamic interface. 
It allowed me to explore advanced concepts in web design, such as responsive layouts, interactive elements, and smooth user experiences.
